**@blizzardofglass**: we should talk here for now

**@SolarWand**: I thought you said the datacenter was gone

**@blizzardofglass**: turns out it was a normal outage, it's been back since last midnight. funny considering all the other stuff

**@blizzardofglass**: did you download the maps?

**@SolarWand**: Yes

**@blizzardofglass**: are you alright?

**@SolarWand**: THE FUCK DO YOU MEAN ALRIGHT

**@blizzardofglass**: i mean, you were pretty disturbed

**@SolarWand**: YEAH I WAS AND FUCKING AM DID YOU *SEE* THAT SHIT

**@blizzardofglass**: [image attachment]

**@SolarWand**: Wh

**@blizzardofglass**: you liked komodo monitors so i found some images of them for you

**@blizzardofglass**: [image attachment]

**@blizzardofglass**: [image attachment]

**@SolarWand**: Are you stupid

**@blizzardofglass**: [image attachment]

**@SolarWand**: You are fucking stupid

**@blizzardofglass**: i am trying to use a neutrally pleasant thing to distract you from the bad thing

**@blizzardofglass**: is it working?

**@SolarWand**: I AM NOT A FUCKING CHILD

**@blizzardofglass**: sorry

**@SolarWand**: FUCK YOU

**@SolarWand**: Can you treat me like an adult ONCE

**@SolarWand**: Please

**@blizzardofglass**: you keep assuming adults don't show care and support to each other

**@blizzardofglass**: you should rest at the next farm down this road

**@SolarWand**: I LITERALLY JUST ASKED

**@SolarWand**: IM NOT EVEN TIRED YET

**@blizzardofglass**: no this is actually for a different reason

**@SolarWand**: That being?

**@blizzardofglass**: i made contact with a group of survivors moving in the same direction as you, but closer to the highway. three people, two of them were poachers and can navigate woods to the west without maps

**@blizzardofglass**: i directed them to the next farm as a meeting point. they'll pick you up and you'll continue without using major roads

**@SolarWand**: Are you serious

**@SolarWand**: I FUCKING HATE THE WOODS

**@blizzardofglass**: i know, but they are actually the best bet here

**@blizzardofglass**: you won't be alone

**@SolarWand**: DID YOU FORGET ABOUT THE FUCKING LARVA?????

**@blizzardofglass**: i reported it to green guys yesterday, they covered it in napalm

**@SolarWand**: The same green guys who crucify civvies on their APCs?????? Are the worms finally getting to you???????????????

**@blizzardofglass**: detachments that were farther out from the bite didn't go bad. capital thinks it's a mutiny, they're pulling artillery and armor from neighbouring regions. i expect they'll start engaging in a few hours

**@blizzardofglass**: that's one more reason to avoid roads

**@SolarWand**: What if the larva already spawned

**@blizzardofglass**: yeah it's likely a few rabbits were caught in the range. if the original is smaller than a fox they usually go down to small arms fire. eventually

**@SolarWand**: I'm pretty sure there are deer in this area

**@blizzardofglass**: i know. we just have to hope

**@SolarWand**: I do NOT like this fucking plan of yours

**@blizzardofglass**: i'm trying to come up with something that doesn't involve woods but failing so far

**@blizzardofglass**: i'll keep trying

**@SolarWand**: No I

**@SolarWand**: You

**@blizzardofglass**: ?

**@SolarWand**: You're probably right and it *is* the best plan now

**@SolarWand**: I don't know shit and should just shut up

**@SolarWand**: I'm not a wizard, you are.

**@blizzardofglass**: i promise i'll do my best to make it less uncomfortable for you

**@SolarWand**: PLEASE JUST

**@SolarWand**: ARGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

**@blizzardofglass**: oh right

**@SolarWand**: Whatever WHATEVER do your thing it doesnt matter
