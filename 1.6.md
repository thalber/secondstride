**currentuser.username**: what the fuck was that. whats going on

**currentuser.username**: Hey asshole THE HOUSE ACROSS THE STREET EXPLODED ANSWER ME

**NATIONAL DISASTER ALERT**: will you not hurt yourself if i talk?

**currentuser.username**: What? No of course I fucking won't, what's happening

**NATIONAL DISASTER ALERT**: you need to go. something changed in the bite area, spawn are slowly striding out as of 15 minutes ago, you have maybe 50 minutes until one reaches this block

**currentuser.username**: You said they stand and do their thing for 2 days?

**NATIONAL DISASTER ALERT**: yes it was always 2 days but now its different for some reason

**currentuser.username**: Why wait 15 minutes WHERE DID THE EXPLOSION COME FROM I DON'T SEE ANYTHING MOVING

**NATIONAL DISASTER ALERT**: the explosion was me

**currentuser.username**: What.

**NATIONAL DISASTER ALERT**: you said you were going to do something if i messaged you before you talked so i couldn't message you but needed to get your attention so i found an unattended kamikaze drone and drove it into a building nearby i'm sorry sorry it took so long it was a treaded one

**currentuser.username**: YOU

**NATIONAL DISASTER ALERT**: ?

**currentuser.username**: Fuck, you might just be genuine. This is so much like something blizz would pull off it's not even funny.

**NATIONAL DISASTER ALERT**: please just collect your things and go

**currentuser.username**: On it, shithead. Where to

**NATIONAL DISASTER ALERT**: there is a rail terminal in the industrial zone at south-southeast edge of town, personnel already evacuated, you can follow the tracks from there southeast to safe-ish areas

**currentuser.username**: Got it. Anything I should grab from this house?

**NATIONAL DISASTER ALERT**: search the master bedroom, it *might* contain a gun

**currentuser.username**: The hell am I gonna use it for? Tickling a spawn before it rips me limb to limb?

**NATIONAL DISASTER ALERT**: not for spawn. military checkpoints on highways out of here are taking civvies out back and shooting them indiscriminately

**currentuser.username**: What the FUCK.

**NATIONAL DISASTER ALERT**: something is wrong with them, on footage i saw a soldier laughing her lungs out

**NATIONAL DISASTER ALERT**: literally

**NATIONAL DISASTER ALERT**: the rest just didnt care

**NATIONAL DISASTER ALERT**: anyways is the gun there?

**currentuser.username**: The gun case is here but it's empty

**NATIONAL DISASTER ALERT**: guess no gun then

**currentuser.username**: Hold on, I just noticed something

**NATIONAL DISASTER ALERT**: ?

**currentuser.username**: aaahabhahg

**currentuser.username**: I found the gun

**currentuser.username**: and the owner

**currentuser.username**: I dont wanna touch

**currentuser.username**: it

**NATIONAL DISASTER ALERT**: okay, that's fine, please dont look at them

**currentuser.username**: I'm not fucking

**currentuser.username**: I am tired

**NATIONAL DISASTER ALERT**: i know, but please, you need to go now.

**NATIONAL DISASTER ALERT**: it's 4km to the station and maybe 25km along the tracks, the first settlement that hasn't been evacuated is a small village, you can take shelter there, it's certainly out of danger for the next few weeks

**NATIONAL DISASTER ALERT**: i'll track you as best i can. cell service should improve about halfway through. we can get you out, you will live.

**currentuser.username**: Okay

**currentuser.username**: Okay I'm going

**NATIONAL DISASTER ALERT**: i need to do something else now, i will contact you if anything important changes

**NATIONAL DISASTER ALERT**: be safe. stick to cover. good luck
