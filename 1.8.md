**currentuser.username**: Fifth time's the charm. Blizz, are you there? There was some juice in the external battery, my phone is at 35%. I don't know where I am, some abandoned huts on a dirt road. I'm gonna turn off my phone in 30 minutes. Please respond.

**currentuser.username**: Nevermind, I'm leaving it on. Please respond.

**currentuser.username**: Maybe I should FUCK I DONT KNOW Please respond.

**NATIONAL DISASTER ALERT**: hello

**currentuser.username**: OH THANK FUCK you are alive. Did the sprinkler plan work? How do you feel?

**NATIONAL DISASTER ALERT**: like shit

**NATIONAL DISASTER ALERT**: i just woke up and i dont remember much

**NATIONAL DISASTER ALERT**: but im no longer being gradually dissolved

**NATIONAL DISASTER ALERT**: so i assume it did work

**currentuser.username**: YES I AM A GENIUS

**NATIONAL DISASTER ALERT**: you are ;-;

**currentuser.username**: Since when did you start using emoticons? Never saw you do that even when you were horny as shit

**NATIONAL DISASTER ALERT**: since now, i guess. are you safe?

**currentuser.username**: Yeah I uh. Ran away

**NATIONAL DISASTER ALERT**: often a reasonable choice. what was the situation

**currentuser.username**: Fuck I don't even know how to describe it there was like

**currentuser.username**: I followed the tracks for maybe 15 kilometers and everything was fine but in the middle of bumfuck nowhere was a locomotive

**currentuser.username**: The engine was still running

**currentuser.username**: And in front of it there was something on the tracks I

**currentuser.username**: I think it might have been a larva? It was all goopy and stuff and things were growing out of it. Trees and grass around it were fucked up

**currentuser.username**: And it saw me

**NATIONAL DISASTER ALERT**: that is REALLY not good.

**currentuser.username**: YEAH NO SHIT SHERLOCK IT WAS FUCKING HORRIFYING

**currentuser.username**: ITS LIKE IT WAS XRAYING MY FUCKING BRAIN

**currentuser.username**: I ran back to the closest split and hid in that little split man hut with all glass windows

**currentuser.username**: And waited for you to respond

**NATIONAL DISASTER ALERT**: did you hear or see anything follow you?

**currentuser.username**: I DONT KNOW IT WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF A FOREST I HATE FOREST NOISES EVEN WHEN THERE ARE NO LARVAE

**NATIONAL DISASTER ALERT**: sorry

**currentuser.username**: Shut up.

**currentuser.username**: The split also had a dirt road coming off the side so I just walked off because theres no fucking way I'm spending a night on a road with THAT THING

**currentuser.username**: I took some turns in the dusk I think

**currentuser.username**: Now I don't know where I am.

**currentuser.username**: Hello?

**NATIONAL DISASTER ALERT**: sorry i think i dozed off? i feel really weak.

**currentuser.username**: Blizzy get your shit together and tell me where I am. I will NOT spend another night in the fucking woods I HATE WOODS

**NATIONAL DISASTER ALERT**: sorry sorry give me 10 minutes i'll try

**currentuser.username**: Try what?

**currentuser.username**: Taking a quick nap?

**currentuser.username**: Ugh

**NATIONAL DISASTER ALERT**: ok im back i uh

**NATIONAL DISASTER ALERT**: your signal is weak, something might have taken out closest towers, i can only narrow it down to a 6km wide area. i don't see any buildings marked in there, even on OSM. can you estimate how far you went from the railroad?

**currentuser.username**: No I can't, my heart was feeling like it was going to explode. It was getting dark when I began walking and dark when I barged in here.

**NATIONAL DISASTER ALERT**: thats not a lot of information

**currentuser.username**: No shit.

**NATIONAL DISASTER ALERT**: i think i found the split you were at, and some dirt roads but i don't know which one you're on. they all lead vaguely east-south-east and bump into different small villages

**NATIONAL DISASTER ALERT**: last i checked this area was completely evacuated and there was no reason for military to camp there. you can just keep heading away from the railroad until you get better bearings

**currentuser.username**: Yeah that definitely beats going back or through the forest. What if I bump into another one of these fuckers though?

**NATIONAL DISASTER ALERT**: i don't know

**currentuser.username**: Shit my water is almost out

**currentuser.username**: And phone is down to 18%

**currentuser.username**: I'm moving out and turning it off, see you when I find... anything really

**NATIONAL DISASTER ALERT**: wait

**currentuser.username**: What.

**NATIONAL DISASTER ALERT**: i um

**currentuser.username**: You um what?

**NATIONAL DISASTER ALERT**: thank you ;w;

**currentuser.username**: Never use emoticons again.

**NATIONAL DISASTER ALERT**: [message failed to send] sorry i just want to cry so hard i wish i had eyes
