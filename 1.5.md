**currentuser.username**: WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU HELPING ME AND NO ONE ELSE?? WHAT DO YOU NEED

**currentuser.username**: WHY DIDNT YOU WARN THE ENTIRE AREA

**currentuser.username**: IF YOU'RE SOME SORT OF DIGITAL GOD WHY DIDNT YOU USE THE PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT SYSTEM OR THE CELL ALERTS

**currentuser.username**: WHY did you do THAT??? I'LL NEVER UNHEAR THAT FUCKING SCREAM IT'S

**currentuser.username**: Shut up

**currentuser.username**: I have an IDEA.

**currentuser.username**: If you send me another message before I decide to talk to you, I'll do SOMETHING STUPID. And I'll send you a selfie too, that would only be fair.

**currentuser.username**: Now go fuck yourself, I'm going to sleep.
